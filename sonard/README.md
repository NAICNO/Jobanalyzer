This is a small program that runs sonar repeatedly with sensible options for a given scenario.

There is some documentation about how to use this in [the sonalyze manual](../sonalyze/MANUAL.md),
look for the section "CRUDE, HIGH-LEVEL PROFILING".

It was originally a bash script, but as bash is a somewhat insane language the program was rewritten
in go.
