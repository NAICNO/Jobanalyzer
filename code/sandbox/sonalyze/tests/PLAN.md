# Testing plan

## jobs

- all min/max switches including min-runtime
  - mostly some arbitrary values will be fine
- no-gpu and some-gpu
- completed and running
- zombie
- numjobs
- fmt options
  - config required for some, and these are important
- batch (with suitable fox logs)
  - merging and formatting are more interesting
  - requires config, actually
