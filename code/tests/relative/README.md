# Relative test cases

These tests run two versions of the same program with the same arguments and compare the outputs,
which should be bitwise identical.  They are meant to be run manually, for now.

The current (2024-10-27) tests here are some old tests that were used to test the rewrite of
sonalyze from Rust to Go.  They probably don't work any more, but the principle is right and the
intent is for them to be resurrected.
