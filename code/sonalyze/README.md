Sonalyze is an aggregation and query front-end for Sonar data.  Its job is to make sense of the
Sonar data in various ways, perform selections on the data, and present results in useful form (both
human-readable and machine-readable).  By and large, other components in the ecosystem should always
go via Sonalyze to access Sonar data.
