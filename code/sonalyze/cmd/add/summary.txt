Add new data to the database.

Data are read from stdin, the type and format are implied by operations
-sample, -sysinfo, or -slurm-sacct, one of which must be specified:

  `add -sample` adds `sonar ps` data.  The format must be "free CSV", ie CSV
  with name=value field syntax and no fixed colums.

  `add -sysinfo` adds `sonar sysinfo` data.  The format must be JSON.

  `add -slurm-sacct` adds `sonar slurm` data.  The format must be free CSV.

Mostly this command is only run by the daemon; manual use is for
experiments and bugfixes.
