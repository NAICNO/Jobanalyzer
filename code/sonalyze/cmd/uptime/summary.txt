Display information about uptime and downtime of nodes and components.

The output is a timeline with uptime and downtime printed in ascending
order, hosts before devices on the host.  Periods where the node/device is
up or down are both printed, but one can select one or the other with
`-only-up` and `-only-down`.

The `-interval` switch must be specified and should be the interval in
minutes for samples on the nodes in question.

A host or device is up at the start of the timeline if its first Sample is
within a small factor of the interval of the `from` time, and ditto it is
up at the end for its last Sample close to the `to` time.
