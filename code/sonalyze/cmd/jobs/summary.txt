Display jobs jobs aggregated from process samples.

A "job" is aggregated from sample streams from one or more processes on one
or more nodes of a cluster.  On some clusters, jobs have clearly defined job
numbers (provided by a batch system such as Slurm), while on other clusters,
the job numbers are inferred from the process tree.

As jobs are built from samples, the job data can be noisy and may sometimes
not represent true behavior.  This is especially true for short jobs.

Note also:

  - A job can be selected by job number, but a time window must be selected
    that contains the job or the job will not be found

  - By default, only the jobs for the current user's user name are selected,
    specify "-user -" to see all users
