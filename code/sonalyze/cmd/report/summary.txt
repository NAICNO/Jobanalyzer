Serve static files from the server's protected report directory.

`sonalyze report` will serve a static file from the report directory
for the cluster, with access controls.  (Access controls require
superuser privileges, as there are no per-user reports.)

The option -report-name selects a file by full name in the data directory.
The file name extension will determine the mime type in the remote case.
Normally these will be csv, txt or json files.  Any file in that directory
is fair game, even the txt files.

Typically the reports served this way are regenerated periodically by
cronjobs, but contain somewhat sensitive data.
