EXPERIMENTAL: Print per-cpu load across time for one or more nodes.

The fixed output format is like this:

NodeName
   Time ...oO..O...o...o...
   Time ...oO..O...O...o...
   Time ...oO..O.......O...
   ...

where the characters represent CPUs in order and there is a mark indicating
how busy the cpu was during the previous time interval.  The mark is "."
for "not busy" (< 10% utilization), "o" for somewhat busy (< 25%), and "O"
for busy.

The output is sorted by node name, then by time.
