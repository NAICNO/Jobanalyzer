EXPERIMENTAL: Extract information from sacct data independent of sample data.

Data are extracted by sacct for completed jobs on a cluster and stored
in Jobanalyzer's database.  These data can be queried by `sonalyze
sacct`.  The fields are generally the same as those of the sacct
output, and have the meaning defined by sacct.
