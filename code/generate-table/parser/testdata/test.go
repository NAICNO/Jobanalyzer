SUMMARY NodeCommand

Display self-reported information about nodes in a cluster.

For overall cluster data, use "cluster".  Also see "config" for
closely related data.

The node configuration is time-dependent and is reported by the node
periodically, it will usually only change if the node is upgraded or
components are inserted/removed.

HELP NodeCommand

  Extract information about individual nodes on the cluster from sysinfo and present
  them in primitive form.  Output records are sorted by node name.  The default
  format is 'fixed'.
