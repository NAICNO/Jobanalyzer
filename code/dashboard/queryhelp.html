    <h1>Query help</h1>
    
    <p> The query expression selects a subset of all nodes by applying filters.  </p>

    <h2> Expressions </h2>
    
    <p> Query expression syntax is pretty simple.  These are all expressions: </p>

    <ul>
      <li> A <em>hostname glob</em> is a wildcard expression selecting some hosts where "*" is a
	wildcard that stands for any number of characters, ie, "c1-*" selects all nodes in the
	"c1" group of nodes, while "c1*" selects the "c1", "c10", and "c11" groups.  "*" by itself
	selects all nodes.

      <li> An <em>abbreviation</em> is a word that stands for a pre-defined expression, see the
	list below.  For example, the abbreviation "busy" stands for a complex expression that
	selects all nodes that are deemed busy.

      <li> A <em>relational expression</em> on the form <tt>fieldname <b>relation</b> value</tt>
	selects nodes whose field <em>fieldname</em> has a numeric <em>value</em> that satisfies
	the relational operator, for example, "cpu% > 50" means that the node must be using more
	than 50% of its CPU capacity.  The relational operators are "&lt;", "&lt;=", ">", ">=",
	and "=".  The field names are listed below.

      <li> The <em>logical operations</em> <b>and</b> and <b>or</b> are used to combine query expressions, and
	parentheses <b>(</b> and <b>)</b> are used to group them:
	<tt>login* and (cpu% > 50 or mem% > 50)</tt>.
	
      <li> A set of selected nodes can be complemented by the <b>~</b> operator,
	eg, <tt>~login*</tt> is any node except the login nodes.
    </ul>

    <h2> Field names </h2>
      
    <p> The field names currently defined for the dashboard are those that appear in the table on the
      dashboard.  The "recent" columns have uncapitalized names ("cpu%") while the "longer" columns have
      captitalized names ("Cpu%").</p>

    <ul>
      <li> "cpu%" - the "cpu-recent" field
      <li> "Cpu%" - the "cpu-longer" field (etc)
      <li> "virt%" - the "virt-recent" field
      <li> "res%" - the "res-recent" field
      <li> "gpu%" - the "gpu-recent" field
      <li> "gpumem%" - the "gpumem-recent" field (this is physical RAM)
      <li> "cpufail" - the "cpu-status" field
      <li> "gpufail" - the "gpu-status" field
      <li> "users" - the "users-recent" field
      <li> "jobs" - the "jobs-recent" field
      <li> "violators" - the "violators" field
      <li> "zombies" - the "zombies" field
    </ul>
    
    <p> Note in the above that "cpu" means "main processor" regardless of node type. </p>

    <h2> Abbreviations </h2>

    <p> The predefined abbreviations are these:
      <ul>
	<li> "compute" is "c*"
	<li> "gpu" is "gpu*"
	<li> "hugemem" is "hugemem*"
	<li> "login" is "login*"
	<li> "cpu-busy" is "cpu% >= 50"
	<li> "cpu-idle" is "cpu% &lt; 50"
	<li> "virt-busy" is "virt% >= 50"
	<li> "virt-idle" is "virt% &lt; 50"
	<li> "res-busy" is "res% >= 50"
	<li> "res-idle" is "res% &lt; 50"
	<li> "gpu-busy" is "gpu and gpu% >= 50"
	<li> "gpu-idle" is "gpu and gpu% &lt; 50"
	<li> "gpumem-busy" is "gpu and gpumem% >= 50"
	<li> "gpumem-idle" is "gpu and gpumem% &lt; 50"
	<li> "cpu-down" is "cpufail > 0"
	<li> "gpu-down" is "gpu and gpufail > 0"
	<li> "busy" is "cpu-busy or gpu-busy or virt-busy or res-busy or gpumem-busy"
	<li> "idle" is "cpu-idle and virt-idle and res-idle and (~gpu or gpu-idle and gpumem-idle)"
	<li> "down" is "cpu-down or gpu-down"
      </ul>

    <p> These have Capitalized variants for the "*-longer" data where that makes sense, eg, "Idle")</p>

    <p> For example, to find nodes with spare capacity, simply run "idle".  ("Idle" is a poor
      moniker for something running at 49% utilization, so perhaps we want something more subtle.

    <p> Perhaps you want hugemem nodes with regular compute capacity: try "hugemem and idle".</p>

    <p> It's easy to add abbreviations - but at this time the abbreviations must be added in the
      query engine, they can't be added by the user.
