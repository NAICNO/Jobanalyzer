TODO:

UX
 - show time along x axis somehow
 - if data goes off the chart, then do something about scaling the chart
 - show a legend somewhere about the meaning of data
 - the rightmost point is frequently down at zero, this is not helpful, so what to do?  whose fault?  anyway
   we should not show this
 - handle files that don't exist (eg ml4 has no data in sonalyze output, hence no file produced)
   right now there's a fetch error but probably should have something better - either force the creation
   of the file, or throw up a message
 - tooltip could show user:job for top jobs, see more below

Data
 - define what we're actually looking at (that is, what are the data plotted)
 - rmem data for ml7 is literally off the charts - what's the deal with that???  Reaches 115%.  This
   could just be that the memory is oversubscribed but I though we were measuring resident data?
   Observe the growth curve though: Goes up high, and then plummets.  Looks like a job that was killed.
 - same with rmem for ml8 going back a few days
 - ml7 also has this problem with CPU, going back a while!  Looks fishy!!
 - weird artifact on ml2 - all data drop to zero for several hours - looks like the host stopped, somehow?
   or disk went away?  this could have been when the PAM authorization failed and cron could not run...

Functionality
 - is it useful to select absolute data rather than relative data?
 - see if jobgraph has anything to offer in terms of ideas
 - this is maybe a bridge too far, but it would be possible, for any point, to have a list of either
   the user names or command names or job numbers (or maybe username:job) that are the top consumers,
   usually there will be just a few.  that way, this dashboard serves the purpose of visualizing the
   cpu hogs.  not urgent.
