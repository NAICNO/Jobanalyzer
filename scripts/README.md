These are scripts that run sonalyze to generate various raw data and then run the output through awk
to produce simple reports.  They take no parameters; they must be configured by changing the code.

In principle we could move these scripts into naicreport (once naicreport has the ability to run
sonalyze remotely), but they are so simple that it is not yet necessary.  Let them prove their worth
first.
